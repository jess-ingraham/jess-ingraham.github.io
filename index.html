						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							I am currently a junior at New York University persuing a bachelor's of arts in computer science with a minor in web development and mathematics. I am currently a tutor for New York University's Computer Science Department. I am a tutor for the Database Design and Web Implementation class under Professor Deena Engel. I am also in a club called Pulse Dance Project, which I created a website for listed under my personal projects above. Pulse is an all-University student run dance club that performs at different events around NYU and also holds its own showcase at the end of every semester.
							<br/><br/>
							I grew up in western Massachusetts with my parents and my older brother. I attended Easthampton High School in Easthampton MA, where I was part of the drama club, National Honor Society, and played soccer for a few years. During highschool, I worked at Cinemark Movie Theaters in Hadley, MA as a concession stand employee.

						<h2>Previous Jobs and Internships</h2>
						<h3 id="ABT">American Ballet Theatre</h3>
						<p>
							From September to December of 2017, I interned for the Membership department of the American Ballet Theatre in New York. During my internship I assisted in maintaining their Raiser's Edge database by updating donors accounts as well as performing analytics by pulling queries and compiling the results. I also contacted donors about any issues that may have come up during their donation processesing. I assisted in processesing the donation that came into the membership department and the acknowledgement letters that were sent to donors. I worked with the other interns to help set up and facilitate events at the American Ballet Theatre Offices as well as at the Koch Theatre in Lincoln center.
							<br/><br/>
							While my time at the American Ballet Theatre was not as technical as I would have wanted it to be, I learned a lot about how companies, especially one that relies on donors, use their data to reach out to donors. There was a lot of analysis about when most people donate and which requests get the most responses. I was also interning when the company was redesigning their website, so I was able to witness what concepts they weren't understanding and how redesigning a website is approached from the client standpoint.

						<h3>Easthampton Savings Bank</h3>
						<p>
							From June to August of 2017 I interned for the Projects department of bankESB in Easthampton Massachusetts. I worked with the Project Manager and Project Coordinator to assist in upkeeping and implementing new softwares for both employees of the bank, and customers of the bank. For most of the summer, I had a daily task to log all of the complaints that reached the bank from customers about the new bill-pay platform that had recently been changed. I also worked with the IT department to maintain bankESB's intranet where daily annoucnments and important documents are stored. I would add a new post to the main page when a request for a new post was emailed to the IT department. 
							<br/><br/>
							The biggest project I worked on during my internship was assisting in implementing a Person-to-Person payment system. I was an intern during the very first meeting with the FinTech and worked all summer on the project with the project coordinator. I sat in meetings with the representatives from the FinTech and COCC to coordinate the release of the product; I created testing guides for in-depth error testing and for other bank employees to test the product; I wrote a white paper for the system; I kept error logs and reported any issues we may have with the product. The department decided at the end of the summer to not use the Person-to-Person system due to errors within the system but being able to see the steps of implementing a new software within a business was invaluable.

						<h3>American Eagle Outfitters</h3>
						<p>
							My sophomore year in college I worked at Aerie, a sub-division of American Eagle Outfitters, in New York City. I worked as a Stock Associate but was also trained to work on the sales floor. I worked to keep the stock room and sales floor clean and organized so that customers and associates would be able to find products. I received deliveries and unpacked new products. Towards the end of my time, I was delegating responsibilities to other stock associates and working directly with the store stock lead and store managers to make sure everything stayed up to the proper standards. I eventually left due to the end of the school year.
