                        <p>Hi, I'm Jess. I am currently a senior at New York University, graduating in the spring of 2019.
                            I am studying Computer Science in the College of Arts and Science.

                            I am currently in a dance club called Pulse Dance Project and you can find a mock website I created for them in the menu under "Personal Projects". This website is not official use but is a project that I work on when I have time and get some inspiration. Because of this, the site is not finished and is in a constant state of updating.

                            Ticket operations specialists track tickets that are bought for customers. When the runners return with ticktets they have bought, I pull reports and place the tickets into envelopes for the customers. I check tickets each night and before showtimes to check that we have all tickets. I keep in contact with concierge agents for any questions they have and track any guests who did not arrive for their show. I collaborate with the guest services team to get tickets to customers who have missed their shows. I work with other members on the fulfillment team to ensure all daily responsibilities are completed in a timely manner and keep record of any tasks that have yet to be completed for the week.

I bought the tickets, confirmed the orders, stuffed the tickets into their envelops, organized tickets by performance, checked tickets the night before to ensure correctness, checked tickets before the performance, and was a point of contact for the concierge agents that were at the show for any issues or questions that may arise.

                            Three Bridges Capital is a European Hedge Fund. During my internship the prgramming team was working on building an accounting system and bringing their accounting in house. My job was building, altering, and maintaing tables, views, and stored procedures for the database side. I also logged errors in the data and created stored procedures to update data when the end user fixes the error (ie if a new country code is not listed in a table already, an error is logged. Once that country code is accounted for, the stored procedure finds all the rows that had that country code and updates it.)<br /><br /> This internship was a lot of SQL and data processing and I learned a lot about production side databases. Starting this internship was my first exposure to a large data warehouse and really showed me how to normalize data for ease of use and readability.

The students learn to scrub data files without using pandas or numpy and then those libraries are used at the end of the course. This way, students understand how to read in, filter, and scrub text/csv files. Students also learn how to use python to connect to an SQL database and template a webpage based on results.<br /><br /> My job was to tutor all the students.

                            From September to December of 2017, I interned for the Membership department of the American Ballet Theatre in New York. During my internship I assisted in maintaining their Raiser's Edge database by updating donors accounts as well as performing analytics by pulling queries and compiling the results. I also contacted donors about any issues that may have come up during their donation processesing. I assisted in processesing the donation that came into the membership department and the acknowledgement letters that were sent to donors. I worked with the other interns to help set up and facilitate events at the American Ballet Theatre Offices as well as at the Koch Theatre in Lincoln center. <br /><br/>While my time at the American Ballet Theatre was not as technical as I would have wanted it to be, I learned a lot about how companies, especially one that relies on donors, use their data to reach out to donors. There was a lot of analysis about when most people donate and which requests get the most responses. I was also interning when the company was redesigning their website, so I was able to witness what concepts they weren't understanding and how redesigning a website is approached from the client standpoint.

I worked with the Project Manager and Project Coordinator to assist in upkeeping and implementing new softwares for both employees of the bank, and customers of the bank. For most of the summer, I had a daily task to log all of the complaints that reached the bank from customers about the new bill-pay platform that had recently been changed. I also worked with the IT department to maintain bankESB's intranet where daily annoucnments and important documents are stored. I would add a new post to the main page when a request for a new post was emailed to the IT department.<br/><br/>The biggest project I worked on during my internship was assisting in implementing a Person-to-Person payment system. I was an intern during the very first meeting with the FinTech and worked all summer on the project with the project coordinator. I sat in meetings with the representatives from the FinTech and COCC to coordinate the release of the product; I created testing guides for in-depth error testing and for other bank employees to test the product; I wrote a white paper for the system; I kept error logs and reported any issues we may have with the product. The department decided at the end of the summer to not use the Person-to-Person system due to errors within the system but being able to see the steps of implementing a new software within a business was invaluable.

I worked to keep the stock room and sales floor clean and organized so that customers and associates would be able to find products. I received deliveries and unpacked new products. Towards the end of my time, I was delegating responsibilities to other stock associates and working directly with the store stock lead and store managers to make sure everything stayed up to the proper standards. I eventually left due to the end of the school year.

By the end of my time there, I was acting in a supervisory position, delegating roles and being a go-between for co-workers and manangers.

                            From course description: In this class, the goal of the project for this class is to build a data product. We will discuss more what this means, but at the minimum we expect the final deliverable to give the ability to users to interact with the project (through a chatbot, or through a web front end), and allow the users to get something meaningful from the underlying data.<br/><br/>So far we have used api's to get ingormation from a website and used the watson nlp api to analyse the sentiment and emotion. We have used regular expression to scrape websites. My team and I are currently working on ideas for our final project.

                            This course is a practical introduction to creating modern web applications. It will cover full stack web development - from database design all the way through client side interactivity. Students will use current server and client side web frameworks to build dynamic, data-driven sites. Various tools to support development will also be introduced, such as version control and build systems. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            I decided to take this course because I found a love for UI/UX and creating website. Like the description said, we covered full stack web devolopment technologies. We covered node.js, server creation from scratch, using the net module, and using express, handlebars, databases such as mongoDB and more. Examples of work from this class will be available on my github at the end of the class as they are currently in private repositories to prevent cheating. This class is one of the most fun classes I have taken.

                            From course description: After this course, you should be able to understand what happens under the hood when your computer executes programs. You will be able to visualize the big picture that shows how software and hardware are interrelated. The main goal of this class is to teach you how computers work under-the-hood to execute programs and manipulate data. The course will start with the C programming language, down to assembly and machine-level code, to basic operating system and architectural concepts.

                            This course was an introductory course to databases and database design. We used SQLite and mySQL for databases and used python to format the data on a webpage. This class focused on how to properly model a database based on information given and what that information would be used for. I became a tutor for this course the following semester.
